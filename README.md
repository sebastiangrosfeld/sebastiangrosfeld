### Hello there 👋

I am a second-year student in applied computer science.
I constantly improve my coding skills through many projects in my classes at the Warsaw University of Technology.
I have basic experience with technologies:

- C/C++
- Java/JavaFx
- Database with MsSQL
- Python for DataScientist(NumPy, Pandas and other)
- Git/Azure DevOps
- Scrum
- Microsoft Azure
- Linux

In the future, I'm going to learn Spring framework.
I'm looking for a job.
